    description: "At this time the Christchurch City Council had not made a memorial for the earthquake victims. When David Bolam-Smith who comissioned the KAHIKATEA Memorial Sculpture was in Tokyo attending a fund raising dinner for the Christchurch and Tohoku area Japan earthquakes, he had a chat with Mr. Ian Kennedy the then New Zealand Ambassador in Tokyo about the need to have some form of memorial for the Japanese Students. As a result, it was suggested by them to make a sculpture for the Japanese, so when the parents come to Christchurch in Feburary 2012, they have a focal point to remember their lost ones. Funds for the KAHIKATEA Memorial Sculpture were raised in Japan by the Japan Asia-Pacific Ladies Friendship Society and Japanese companies. The sculpture commissioned by David Bolam-Smith, artist Annabel Menzies-Joyce and lighting designer Kevin Cawley, it was unveiled in Christchurch on the first anniversary of the February 22nd 2011 earthquake at an event attended by approximately 100 family members at Christ Collage Chapple.",
